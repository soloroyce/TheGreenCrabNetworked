Thank you for purchasing Toon Nature Assets!

If you like it, pleaase review it :)

	Version 1.1.1:

The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.
Objects are easy to place in the scene if you use vertex snapping, or if you use a 1x1 grid placement system.

All models come with centered pivot points at the base.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and objects that may be animated on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of a vehicle uses the name "Wheel_F.R”

Each model uses the toon shader, and most assets use the same material with an atlased texture.
The water shader is unlit, so when changin lighting settings, say from day to night, you might want to edit the colors to better match the lighting.

A few assets, such as vehicles, streetlights and buildings have lighting addons in the object hierarchy.
If you plan on using the assets during day-time light settings, you might want to disable those.

Added URP compatibility from 2019.4 and later.
Please see the "URP_Instructions" file in the "Documentation" folder.

Updated Unity version to 2018.4.0 LTS
